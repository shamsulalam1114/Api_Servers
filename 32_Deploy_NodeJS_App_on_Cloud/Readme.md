## Deploy NodeJS App to Cloud

- We can't set `PORT` for App on the server by own.
- We need a enviournment variable i.e. Dynamic Variable. 
- Enviornment variable is set by cloud.
- `process.env.Variable_Name`
- For cloud sever make sure you have start script `"start": "node app.js"`
- For  Node.js, the main file is typically app.js
